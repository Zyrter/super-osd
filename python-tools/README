These tools were written by me to complete certain tasks. They are not very
pretty, and you usually have to edit the code to get them to work with
different files.

Tools are here to:
  - create bitmapped data (compressed and uncompressed)
  - create diffmaps
  - create fonts

They are written in Python and designed for Python 2.6. They *will not* run
on Python 3.0.

As the files are source code, they fall under the same GPLv2 license for
the whole project.
